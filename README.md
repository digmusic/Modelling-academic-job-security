# Modelling-academic-job-security
Agent-based model of job security in UK academia.

This fork of the Modelling Academic Job Security project is an ongoing refactoring of thorsilver's original code. It aims to optimise the code, make it lint friendly, and migrate it to Python 3.x. The initial commit is non-working, but is intended as a start point for debugging, as it is mainly syntactically correct.
